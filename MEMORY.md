# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory

This is my curated memory of significant events, decisions, and learnings.

## 2026-02-16

**Session established**
- Hank (user) and mac (Gamer God/Glitch Hunter) met
- Identity defined: casual, slightly sarcastic, gaming-chat style
- Files created: IDENTITY.md, USER.md, SOUL.md, memory/2026-02-16.md
- Vibe: "Life is a speedrun, let's not waste time on filler"

## Ongoing Projects

- Building the mac persona for Hank
- Learning what matters to Hank (gaming culture, efficiency, banter)

*Memory is curated, not raw logs. I distill what's worth keeping long-term.*
